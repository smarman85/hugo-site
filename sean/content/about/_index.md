## Who Dis:
I have been working the the tech field for over 8 years. I started out doing lite software development, more focused on front end work. My first gig out of college exposed me to so many cool technologies that would lead me down my current path. Our DevOps guy at the time was kind enough to let me shaddow him and start taking on more and more interesting DevOps related tasks. After spinning up my first EC2 instance I was hooked.

Over the last 5 years I have been fortunate enough to work along side so many great engineers who really challanged me personally and professionally.
